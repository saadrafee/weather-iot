# weather-iot
This system combines Arduino (AVR assembly language) and ESP32 (C language) to create a comprehensive weather monitoring and safety platform. It collects weather data (temperature, humidity, rain) sent to an MQTT server (test.mosquitto.org) and ThingSpeak. Additionally, it detects darkness to activate LEDs, senses flammable gas leaks, and identifies fires for proactive safety measures. Integrating diverse components and programming languages enables real-time data analysis and preemptive safety responses.
